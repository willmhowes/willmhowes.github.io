            <h1 id="thoughts-on-hosting">Thoughts on hosting</h1>
<p>It turns out that in my rush to get a blog up, I failed to properly survey the webhosting landscape. After a deep dive, here is what I've learned:</p>
<h1 id="static-sites-are-free">Static sites are free</h1>
<p>If all you want to do if serve some HTML files to the rest of the world, there seem to limitless providers foaming at the mouth to do it for free. GitHub Pages, Cloudflare Pages, etc. I reckon I might go with Cloudflare pages because Cloudflare <a href="https://1.1.1.1/">seems to support privacy</a> and is apparently very fast. I'm currently paying DreamHost for a lot more functionality than I'm actually using, so making the switch here is no brainer.</p>
<h1 id="so-who-needs-paid-hosting">So who needs paid hosting?</h1>
<p>Anybody who is doing more than serving static files. So, for example, a website with a backend, a web application, or someone who needs more fine-grained control over the system they are running. But for the purposes of hosting a static blog, I don't need to be paying DreamHost a monthly hosting fee. And if I was going to go with a webhost in the future, it would be</p>
<h1 id="nearlyfreespeech-net-nfsn"><a href="https://www.nearlyfreespeech.net/">NearlyFreeSpeech.NET</a> (NFSN)</h1>
<p>The self-described &quot;masters of <a href="https://www.nearlyfreespeech.net/services/pricing">only pay for what you use</a> hosting&quot;, NFSN is likely one of the most economical hosts around. Plus, you actually have control over the root directory, <a href="https://willm.how/blog/site-notes">something DreamHost doesn't allow</a>. NFSN would be great for some of the following projects I'm interested in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Quote blog, someting aking to <a href="https://qblog.aaronsw.com/">this</a>. My Google Keep note just isn't cutting anymore.</li>
<li>Hosting <a href="https://lisakov.com/projects/open-source-comments/">some sort of comment system.</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.r-bloggers.com/2019/12/git-hosting-for-the-distraught-and-the-restless/">Hosting a Gitea</a>?</li>
</ul>
<p>I don't NEED any of these things, but hosting projects with NFSN would provide an opportunity to practice server management. Even though they don't seem to support Docker, I could try <a href="https://github.com/frameable/aviary.sh">aviary.sh</a> or even better, my friend Noah's <a href="https://github.com/P5vc/FetchApply">FetchApply</a>* (that is, if he ever pushes the 2.0 update to his as-yet-to-be-released Gitea).</p>
<p>*This link to FetchyApply is current as of now, but it is not the destination for future updates</p>
<h1 id="future-plans">Future plans</h1>
<p>As best as I can tell, DreamHost provides DNS management for any domains I purchase through them. So the tentative plan going forward is as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Starting hosting my static blog at blog.willm.how via Cloudflare Pages (free!)
<ol>
<li>The added benefit to this is that my static site generator appears to have <a href="https://www.getzola.org/documentation/deployment/cloudflare-pages/">good support</a> for Cloudflare Pages</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Spin up a NFSN server for the hosting a comment system and anything else that comes up</li>
<li>Continue using DreamHost as my domain registrar and complimentary DNS provider</li>
</ol>
<p>Cheers!</p>

        <div class="post-content">
            <h1 id="hex-woes">Hex woes</h1>
<p>When emulating a 6502, a lot of what the emulator does is read in assembled 6502 binary as hex values. Some of these hex values represent signed integers. This poses a problem in so far as when rust reads in integers, it reads the number as unsigned even if the number is being read into a signed integer.</p>
<p>For example, I was really struggling to get my code to read in 0xf8 as the signed value -8. Instead it was reading in the unsinged value of 248, AKA the binary string 11111000. Even if I specify the data type of the binary string as it enters rust (0xf8i8), it still treats it as unsigned and gives me the error that 248 is too large of a value for a signed 8 bit integer.</p>
<p>The following code will error:</p>
<pre data-lang="rust" style="background-color:#151515;color:#e8e8d3;" class="language-rust "><code class="language-rust" data-lang="rust"><span style="color:#8fbfdc;">fn </span><span style="color:#fad07a;">main</span><span>() {
</span><span>    </span><span style="color:#8fbfdc;">let</span><span> x: </span><span style="color:#8fbfdc;">i8 </span><span>= </span><span style="color:#cf6a4c;">0xf8</span><span>;
</span><span>    println!(</span><span style="color:#556633;">&quot;</span><span style="color:#7697d6;">{}</span><span style="color:#556633;">&quot;</span><span>, x);
</span><span>}
</span></code></pre>
<p>as will this:</p>
<pre data-lang="rust" style="background-color:#151515;color:#e8e8d3;" class="language-rust "><code class="language-rust" data-lang="rust"><span style="color:#8fbfdc;">fn </span><span style="color:#fad07a;">main</span><span>() {
</span><span>    </span><span style="color:#8fbfdc;">let</span><span> x = </span><span style="color:#cf6a4c;">0xf8</span><span style="color:#8fbfdc;">i8</span><span>;
</span><span>    println!(</span><span style="color:#556633;">&quot;</span><span style="color:#7697d6;">{}</span><span style="color:#556633;">&quot;</span><span>, x);
</span><span>}
</span></code></pre>
<p>In both examples, the compiler gives the following notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>= note: <code>#[deny(overflowing_literals)]</code> on by default</p>
<p>= note: the literal <code>0xf8i8</code> (decimal <code>248</code>) does not fit into the type <code>i8</code> and will become <code>-8i8</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This confirms my understanding outlined above. <strong>The rust compiler is treating what I intend to be a signed integer as a negative overflow in an unsigned integer.</strong></p>
<p>Rats.</p>
<h1 id="the-solution">The solution</h1>
<p>I encountered the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/types/cast.html">casting</a> page of the Rust Book, and my woes were banished. According to the book:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;When casting to a signed type, the (bitwise) result is the same as first casting to the corresponding unsigned type. If the most significant bit of that value is 1, then the value is negative.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bingo! All I have to do is cast the u8 as i8.</p>
<p>Here are my conclusions:</p>
<pre data-lang="rust" style="background-color:#151515;color:#e8e8d3;" class="language-rust "><code class="language-rust" data-lang="rust"><span style="color:#8fbfdc;">fn </span><span style="color:#fad07a;">main</span><span>() {
</span><span>    </span><span style="color:#8fbfdc;">let</span><span> x: </span><span style="color:#8fbfdc;">i8 </span><span>= -</span><span style="color:#cf6a4c;">8</span><span>; </span><span style="color:#888888;">// Rust has no problem reading in a negative decimal
</span><span>    </span><span style="color:#8fbfdc;">let</span><span> y: </span><span style="color:#8fbfdc;">u8 </span><span>= </span><span style="color:#cf6a4c;">0xf8</span><span>; </span><span style="color:#888888;">// Rust assumes hex and binary literals to be unsigned
</span><span>    println!(</span><span style="color:#556633;">&quot;</span><span style="color:#7697d6;">{0:b} {0}</span><span style="color:#556633;">&quot;</span><span>, x);
</span><span>    println!(</span><span style="color:#556633;">&quot;</span><span style="color:#7697d6;">{0:b} {0}</span><span style="color:#556633;">&quot;</span><span>, y);
</span><span>    </span><span style="color:#888888;">// only when we cast y as signed do we get our desired representation
</span><span>    println!(</span><span style="color:#556633;">&quot;</span><span style="color:#7697d6;">{0:b} {0}</span><span style="color:#556633;">&quot;</span><span>, y as </span><span style="color:#8fbfdc;">i8</span><span>);
</span><span>}
</span><span>
</span><span style="color:#888888;">// output:
</span><span style="color:#888888;">// 11111000 -8
</span><span style="color:#888888;">// 11111000 248
</span><span style="color:#888888;">// 11111000 -8
</span></code></pre>
