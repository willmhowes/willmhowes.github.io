I installed [xa65](http://www.floodgap.com/retrotech/xa/). There was a convenient brew formula I used to install it. My goal was to write a 6502 program and the decode it in Python.

It then occured to me that I can't see the state of the memory or the registers if I'm cross-compiling (or cross-assembling?) 6502 code to my own machine. How would I would I be able to tell if the program I was running even did what I was telling it to do? This led me to seek out a proper 6502 emulator, which is how I found Nick Morgan's [Easy 6502](https://skilldrick.github.io/easy6502/) tutorial. It conveniently features a javascript-based 6502 emulator complete with memory and register monitoring, as well as a hexdump feature which gives the 6502 machine code after it has been assembled.

I wrote the following program:

```asm
; countdown.6502.asm
; by Will Howes
;
; counts down from 10 to zero and stores each count in memory
LDX #$10    ; x = 0x10
LDY #10     ; y = 0x0a

loop:
STY $00, X  ; write y to memory[x]
INX         ; x++
DEY         ; y--
CPY #00     ; z = 1 if y == 0 else 0
BNE loop    ; if z != 1 then branch loop
```

which amounts to the following hexdump:

```asm
0600: a2 10 a0 0a 94 00 e8 88 c0 00 d0 f8
```

I found [this](http://www.emulator101.com/6502-addressing-modes.html) page about the 6502's addressing modes to be a very useful reference when programming. Now, to get down to business, I used [this](https://www.masswerk.at/6502/6502_instruction_set.html) opcode reference and wrote the following program:

```python
# Disco5.py
# 6502 hexdump Decoder
# Author: Will Howes

VERBOSE = False

a = 0
x = 0
y = 0
z = 0
pc = None
memory = [0 for x in range(1000)]

# TODO:
# - store system registers in their own list
# - figure out a system for ending runtime
# - make so that end of program is when pc reaches end of memory
#   or illegal opcode
# - interactive debugger (run one instruction at a time and set a
#   keypress which)
#   engages a memory dump or register dump
# - BE SURE TO WRITE WITH TESTS
# - implement more opcodes

def lb (memory, pc):
    return memory[pc], pc+1

def ubyte_to_sbyte(b):
    # pad to 8
    if len(b) < 8:
        b = '0'*(8-len(b)) + b
    if b[0] == '1':
        inv_b = ''.join([(lambda x: '0' if x=='1' else '1')(bit) for bit in b])
        twocomp = int(inv_b,2) + 1
        return -twocomp
    return int(b,2)

def test_ubyte():
    assert(ubyte_to_sbyte(bin(255)[2:]) == -1)
    assert(ubyte_to_sbyte(bin(127)[2:]) == 127)
    assert(ubyte_to_sbyte('11111000') == -8)

with open('countdown.txt') as f:
    lines = f.readlines()

    # only works for one line currently
    for line in lines:
        hexdump = line.split()
        loc = int(hexdump[0][:-1])
        if pc == None:
            pc = loc
        # write instructions to memory
        for instr in hexdump[1:]:
            memory[loc] = int(instr, 16)
            loc += 1

    while pc < len(memory):
        instruction, pc = lb(memory,pc)
        if VERBOSE: print(hex(instruction))

        match instruction:
            case int(0xa2):
                if VERBOSE: print("LDX")
                x, pc = lb(memory,pc)
            case int(0xa0):
                if VERBOSE: print("LDY")
                y, pc = lb(memory,pc)
            case int(0x94):
                if VERBOSE: print("STY")
                zpg, pc = lb(memory,pc)
                memory[zpg + x] = y
            case int(0xe8):
                if VERBOSE: print("INX")
                x+=1
            case int(0x88):
                if VERBOSE: print("DEY")
                y-=1
            case int(0xc0):
                if VERBOSE: print("CPY, Immediate")
                val, pc = lb(memory, pc)
                if y == val: z = 1
                else:        z = 0
            case int(0xd0):
                offset, pc = lb(memory, pc)
                offset = bin(offset)[2:]
                offset = ubyte_to_sbyte(offset)
                if z == 0:
                    pc += offset
                if VERBOSE: print("BNE:", offset, z)

    # print section of memory with results
    print("-----")
    print("0010: {}".format(memory[16:32]))
    print("-----")
```

The decoder is called "disco5" because it sounds cool.

There is more to say about the program and how it works, but I will have to come back to add more later.
