After the thesis meeting, I wanted to read an [article](https://fasterthanli.me/articles/so-you-want-to-live-reload-rust#what-s-a-dylib) recommended by Dylan about runtime code generation.

So I started reading, but it mentioned "nerd sniping" so I had to read the [original](https://xkcd.com/356/) XKCD article in order to understand. I was briefly sidetracked by reading some of the recommended comics at the bottom of the XKCD website ([TWP](http://threewordphrase.com/) and [SMBC](https://www.smbc-comics.com/)).

Then I continued reading the original article in question, but I again became sidetracked when the author mentioned binutils, which I googled. I read the phrase GNU linker and rembered I don't understand the "-c" flag in gcc. I also don't know much about makefiles. So I did some quick research do learn the [first](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43164707/whats-the-meaning-of-gcc-c-and-gcc-o) question, and then more about the second question. I shared the [two](https://www.cs.colby.edu/maxwell/courses/tutorials/maketutor/) [resources](https://makefiletutorial.com/) I found about makefiles with Charlie via Slack and with 221 students via the Discord.

The article is a bit too dense for me to comprehend so I might do well to read [this](https://medium.com/swlh/linux-basics-static-libraries-vs-dynamic-libraries-a7bcf8157779) article first.
