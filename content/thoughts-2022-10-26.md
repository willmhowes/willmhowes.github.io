Things to worry about later:

- Clock
- interupts 

When a binary is on disk, it is not ready to run. And it needs to be linked to the appropriate libraries on the system it is going to be running on.

When you do `nm` on a library, you see all the places that it calls out. It also shows all the symbols that you need to get into it. All these symbols are function calls, and what they refer to is the location in memory of that function's starting address. They can also be global variables. They are just adresses in memory of functions or data structures.

There are shared libraries and dynamic libraries:

1. On a linux system, most of the big libraries are shared. This is done to save memory. Read-only data might as well be shared between programs (ex. C standard libraries). It is a lot of work to make sure everyone knows where the location of the data is.
2. Back when memory was really scarce, you wouldn't want to load things into memory before you needed it.

By default, Rust uses static linking. A rust binary has all the stuff it uses included in the binary.
